SILVER TODO:

waxed block recipes
silver block comparator output

new block ideas:

- every tick output silver block oxidizing (1,2,4,8 ticks)
- silver crates -> double delay then full blocks (3 ticks, 5 ticks, 10 ticks, 20 ticks) reduces power by 1
- slabs and stairs + oxi
- door, trapdoor -> oxidizing determines redstone power need to open
- full block acts like button, full block acts like pressure plate, both oxidizing determines time to stay activated
- block is normal, when activated act like magma (if oxidizing -> 4, 3, 2, 1 damage)
- cut silver blocks, slabs, stairs + oxi
- original block type (deco)
- block that overheats, when powered for x, turn of for x depending on oxidizing state
